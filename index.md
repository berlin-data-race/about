## What is it?

The #Berlindatarace seeks to disrupt how people share their lived experiences within academic conferences by cultivating new and interactive understandings of participant interactions, digital technologies and places.  The data race is an innovative engagement session that can enhance and enrich scholars’ attendance at AoIR through a real-time digital application. Participants experience the conference host city Berlin, through digital and physical practices. This new engagement with AoIR takes the form of a data scavenger hunt that not only takes participants to iconic and hidden places around Berlin, but at the same time facilitates teamwork and fosters greater networking collaborations amongst the AoIR community.

## How does it work?

### Conference-long event
anyone can join in by tweeting using #Berlindatarace during the first two days of the conference (6-7 October). Follow us at @berlindatarace to stay tuned about the missions that will give your team extra points. Information about teams will be available at the start of the conference.

### Session-specific event
only open on 7 October, 4-6pm, focused on the area around the conference venue. Both events count towards the final scores. 

**The winners will be announced at the AoIR AGM: 4pm, 8 October**.

#### Format of the experimental session

Participants will be placed into teams, explore Berlin, and complete missions using the ‘GooseChase’ app, with ‘MapMyWalk’ also used for tracking the team’s journey. The #Berlindatarace GooseChase game contains 100 missions for participants to complete. Teams should complete as many missions as possible during the session (4pm-6pm on Friday 7 October).  The missions feature a mix of Berlin’s history, architecture, art, and pop culture, as well as content that is AoIR specific! Each mission requires participants to either submit a short answer, check in and provide geolocation info, or take and upload a photo or video. For each completed mission, teams will receive a pre-determined point value. By tweeting the team’s experiences, taking pictures, uploading videos, and tracking their movements during the race (using MapMyWalk), each team aims to obtain as many points as possible. The more difficult the mission, the higher the point value. The team with the most accumulated points (including social media points from the first two days of the conference) wins the #Berlindatarace.

#### The race

Participants should download the GooseChase app (and MapMyWalk) to their Android or iOS device; team details will be provided by the #Berlindatarace organisers during the conference. Once signed in to their team account on the app, participants then select missions from the #Berlindatarace list and follow the instructions. Team leaders can track their team’s activity in real-time and view their team’s position on the app’s leaderboard. In addition to the points automatically awarded when participants complete missions through the app, participants can gain extra bonus points by mapping their route and posting #Berlindatarace tweets along the way, always remembering to include their team-specific hashtag.

The #Berlindatarace session itself will finish at the lounge at the **Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG) **(see [http://aoir.org/aoir2016/conference-venue/](http://aoir.org/aoir2016/conference-venue/)). Each team is required to check in by 6pm at the lounge. Teams can then mingle ahead of the banquet at 7pm (or have time to get ready, as they wish). 

Following the completion of the #Berlindatarace session, the facilitators will review the submissions and determine the winning team, based on in-session missions and wider conference activity. At the AGM on Saturday afternoon, the organisers will provide a brief summary of the #Berlindatarace before announcing the winning team and awarding their prize! 

### Teams

**Teams will be allocated at the conference -- details to be provided at the event.**

### Rules

* Use the data race hashtag -- #**Berlindatarace** -- on Twitter to be eligible for the social media points, as well as your team-specific hashtag (to be revealed at the conference).

* Every conference participant will be allocated to one of five teams at the beginning of the conference. Each of your social media activities using #Berlindatarace will count towards your team’s success!

* At the session-specific event, you will meet (some of) your fellow team members in person and work as a team for the remainder of the session using the GooseChase app.

* At the start of the session, teams will be given their login details for completing the #Berlindatarace. Each team will be asked to choose a team champion, who will be responsible for entering your team’s answers. Each team will only use one mobile phone for this.

* You have a limited time to earn as many points as possible - think strategically which challenges to tackle. Also remember, as you only use one account, your team needs to stay together during the session time.

* Each team needs to take and upload a team photo at the beginning and end of the session.

* Additional points can be earned for tracking your team’s journey during the session with MapMyWalk. You can use a second phone for MapMyWalk.

* Team points earned during the session will be added to social media points previously earned to determine the winning team. Special points can be earned in certain categories, which will be announced during the conference and at the beginning of the session (i.e. team with the most steps, biggest team at session, etc.).

* Winners will be announced on Saturday afternoon at the AGM.

* Have fun!
